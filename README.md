Govex is a DAO management platform on Sui.

It allows users to permissionlessly create DAOs and evaluate proposals.

We use decision markets instead of voting, as the consensus mechanism to evaluate whether a proposal should pass or not.

Users can trade on what the predict the fair price of their DAO's native token is if a given proposal was to be accepted or rejected.

This mechanism much more efficent than voting and protects DAO holders while also boosting engagement.
